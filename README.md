# InturnAI
🧠 🔍 What is it?
A personal AI agent that acts like your smart intern.
You give it high-level tasks, and it:

Breaks them down

Researches

Writes code, documents

Updates you with reports

Think of it as your:

Research assistant

Coding buddy

Email summarizer

To-do planner

Knowledge fetcher

🔧 Example Use Cases
Command You Give	What the AI Does
“Build me a roadmap for MAANG roles”	Breaks it into steps, suggests tools/resources
“Make a report on Indian startups in AI”	Scrapes data, summarizes articles, creates PDF
“Write me Python code for stock prediction”	Finds logic, writes + explains the code
“Organize my tasks for this week”	Creates plan, integrates with Google Calendar

🏗️ Suggested Architecture
🧠 Core Components
Command Processor – understands what you asked

Task Planner – breaks task into subtasks

Worker Modules – web scraping, coding, summarization, calendar integration

Memory Module – stores past interactions (can use vector DB like Pinecone)
